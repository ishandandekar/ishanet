This is a codebase for my practice for neural networks. If you want please create a PR for making this repo a better library!!!

The plan is to first replicate joelnet (by Joel grus) and then micrograd (by karpathy). These will allow me to understand the grad engines and make neural nets. I then want to build upon it by implementing optimizers, losses and layers. Which will be done whenever needed.
